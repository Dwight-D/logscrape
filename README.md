# Logscrape

## Description

This program looks for directories likely to contain log files using simple globbing heuristics and looks for files containing matching patterns. It then parses any files containing matches and attempts to output all relevant data according to some predetermined logging patters. 

Suitable for use on files generated by log4j/logback, but can be extended as long as the logging format is sufficiently generic and predictable.

### NB!

This program is written mainly for my own use. Not optimized for handling very large amounts of data and may perform poorly in some cases.

## Instructions

Run with python interpreter or directly from the shell. Takes exactly one positional argument which is the pattern to search for. Default search directory is current working dir, this can be overridden with the optional `-d / --search-dir DIR` switch. Use `-h` for more optional switches.

**Example:**



`logscrape /path/to/some/application`
